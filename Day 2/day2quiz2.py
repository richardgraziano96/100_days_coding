## This calculates the bmi by using weight and height
bmi = (float(weight) / float(height) ** 2)

## Not required but it was nice to add this in for people so they dont need to 
## search it up by themselves

if bmi <= 18.4 :
    print("You are underweight.\n")
elif 18.5 <= bmi <= 24.9 :
    print("You are a normal weight.\n")
elif 25.0 <= bmi <= 29.9 :
    print("You are overweight.\n")
elif bmi > 30.0 :
    print("You are obese.\n")

## Converts the float to an int to print
bmi = int(bmi)

## Prints the BMI as a string
print("Your BMI is: " + str(bmi))
